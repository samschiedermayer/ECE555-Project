# ECE555-Project
This is a class project for UW Madison's ECE 555 "Digital Circuits and Components" class, taught by Professor Umit Ogras. This is the backend design for a very simplified neural network accelerator. Topics covered include standard cell layout and sizing, architecture considerations for power/speed, and interconnect layout.
